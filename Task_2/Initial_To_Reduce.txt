Initially the maximum budget is $10,000. After the reduction it becomes $6,500. The first easy step that I usually think is
that is there any way that I could reduce the cost without reducing the resources specification too much? Turns out that I could
change my resources payment method from on-demand to reserved instance. Assuming that I already know the users estimation per month
(which is 50,000 users) then I could be quiet confident to go for reserved instance. The two most expensive resources are RDS followed
by EC2 with 4 instances. For RDS I changed the pricing model to Standard Reserved Instances with 1 year of reservation and no payment
upfront. For EC2 instances I did the same as well but with partial upfront. With this payment model for RDS and EC2, I could get total
cost of 6,379.32 USD per month which does not exceed 6,500 USD and at the same time use up all the given budget.
